# Pro Upscaler Supabase Integration

## Overview
The Pro Upscaler has been successfully integrated with Supabase for authentication and user management. This replaces the previous custom backend authentication system.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Files Modified/Created
- ✅ `pro-upscaler/client/index.html` - Added Supabase SDK and updated script references
- ✅ `pro-upscaler/client/js/supabase-auth-service.js` - New Supabase authentication service
- ✅ `pro-upscaler/client/js/main.js` - Updated to integrate with Supabase auth
- ✅ `supabase-setup.sql` - Database schema setup commands

### 2. Authentication Features
- ✅ User sign up/sign in with email and password
- ✅ Session management with automatic state changes
- ✅ User profile creation and management
- ✅ Usage tracking and limits enforcement
- ✅ Subscription tier management (free, basic, pro)

### 3. Database Schema
- ✅ `subscription_tiers` table with tier definitions
- ✅ `user_profiles` table extending Supabase auth.users
- ✅ `usage_logs` table for tracking processing usage
- ✅ `monthly_usage` view for usage summaries
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Automatic user profile creation trigger
- ✅ Usage limit checking function

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Project Setup
1. Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vztoftcjbwzwioxarovy
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run all commands from `supabase-setup.sql` to create the database schema

### 2. Authentication Configuration
1. Go to Authentication > Settings in your Supabase dashboard
2. Configure email settings if needed
3. Set up redirect URLs for your domain

### 3. Update Credentials (if needed)
The Supabase credentials are currently hardcoded in `supabase-auth-service.js`:
- URL: `https://vztoftcjbwzwioxarovy.supabase.co`
- Anon Key: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`

## Usage Limits by Tier

### Free Tier
- Standard Upscaling (2x, 4x): Unlimited
- High Resolution (8x+): Unlimited  
- AI Enhancement: 1 per month
- Price: $0.00

### Basic Tier
- Standard Upscaling (2x, 4x): Unlimited
- High Resolution (8x+): Unlimited
- AI Enhancement: 10 per month
- Price: $9.99/month

### Pro Tier
- Standard Upscaling (2x, 4x): Unlimited
- High Resolution (8x+): Unlimited
- AI Enhancement: Unlimited
- Price: $19.99/month

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs up/signs in through the modal
2. Supabase creates/authenticates the user
3. Trigger automatically creates user profile with 'free' tier
4. Auth state changes are automatically handled
5. UI updates to show user info and usage stats

### Usage Tracking
1. Before processing, `checkUsage()` verifies limits
2. Processing type is determined by scale factor and AI enhancement
3. After successful processing, usage is logged with `logUsage()`
4. Monthly usage stats are displayed in the UI

### Processing Types
- `standard`: 2x and 4x upscaling
- `highres`: 8x, 10x, 12x, 15x upscaling  
- `ai_enhancement`: Any upscaling with AI face enhancement enabled

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Start the Client Server
```bash
cd pro-upscaler/client
python3 -m http.server 8081
```

### 2. Open in Browser
Navigate to: `http://localhost:8081`

### 3. Test Authentication
1. Click "Sign Up" to create a new account
2. Verify email if email confirmation is enabled
3. Sign in and check that user info appears in header
4. Usage stats should show "0 (unlimited)" for standard/highres and "0/1" for AI

### 4. Test Usage Limits
1. Try to upscale with AI enhancement enabled
2. Free tier users should be limited to 1 AI enhancement per month
3. After reaching limit, upgrade prompt should appear

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Supabase connection errors**: Check URL and anon key in `supabase-auth-service.js`
2. **Database errors**: Ensure all SQL commands from `supabase-setup.sql` were executed
3. **RLS policy errors**: Check that policies are properly configured
4. **Profile creation errors**: Verify the trigger is working for new users

### Debug Console
Open browser developer tools and check the console for:
- Authentication state changes
- Database query errors
- Usage limit check results

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Stripe Integration**: Add subscription management with Stripe
2. **Email Templates**: Customize Supabase auth emails
3. **Usage Analytics**: Add dashboard for usage monitoring
4. **Subscription Webhooks**: Automate tier changes via Stripe webhooks
5. **Environment Variables**: Move credentials to environment configuration

### Security Considerations
1. The anon key is public and safe to expose in frontend code
2. RLS policies protect user data access
3. All sensitive operations require authentication
4. Consider adding rate limiting for API calls
